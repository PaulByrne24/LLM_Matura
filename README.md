LLM_MATURA

A small scale Large Language Model I'm making for a school project. The final version will be trained with 10 books to provide a diverse array of words and sentence combinations.
These books are atm:

•	"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz" by L. Frank Baum, 
•	"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" by Lewis Carroll, 
•	"1984" by George Orwell, 
•	"Pride and Prejudice" by Jane Austen, 
•	"A Christmas Carol" by Harper Lee, 
•	"Frankenstein" by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, 
•	"The Great Gatsby" by F. Scott Fitzgerald, 
•	"The Three Musketeers" by Alexander Duma, 
•	"The Lord of the Rings" by J.R.R. Tolkien, (still not sure)
•	"Harry Potter" series by J.K. Rowling. (still not sure)


It'll be trained using the PyTorch module and use a GPT-architecture.
